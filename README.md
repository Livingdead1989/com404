# Problem Solving through Programming (COM404)

## Overview

This module introduces students to software implementation through the process of understanding how to solve problems using programming. Concepts of variables, expressions, assignments, control structures, lists and file input/output are explained, and students will explore their implementation in a specified language. While the coding aspect of programming is explored in some depth, the importance of understanding problem domain and planning a solution in a systematic and logical way before resorting to code is also emphasised.

## By the end of this module you will be able to:

* Identify fundamental constructs, syntax and semantics associated with computer programming languages.
* Apply technical knowledge, concepts and skills to the design and construction of computer programs.
* Construct robust computer programs using suitable testing techniques to validate constructed programs.
* Make effective use of IT.
